# Minecraft Lua gate

## Introduction
This mod allows you to code with the lua programming language in minecraft (for now 1.20.1 only).

## Explanation
I just wanted to make minecraft modding more easier and accessible, while you still learn how to code.

The mod aim is to make you able to create, like an item, in only 1 or 2 function(s) call(s).

## Mod status

Client side : about 80% done
Server side : 0%

For now, the mod only allow you to do some bot since its client side only,

AND I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY UNINTENDED USE LIKE CHEATING IN ONLINE SERVERS.

I plan to make almost every modding possibity in java but ported to lua.

Some parts of the mod will be also probably "upgraded" for making things more simpler. 
(like for now inventory sort is using slot id only, which makes it hard to correctly get the right slot every time)

## THANKS !

Thanks a lot to the [Luaj project](https://github.com/luaj/luaj), without it, this project would have not been possible.

and even more, thanks to the fabric devs for making this [awesome mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/) !

## LICENSE NOTICE
the VERY restrictful license will be removed to a CC0 when the project is done.
I simply do not want people to copy, make something awesome in less time, and I would crush my head for month wasted on making this mod.

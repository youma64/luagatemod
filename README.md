# The Lua gate mod

## Introduction
This mod allows you to code with the lua programming language in minecraft (for now 1.20.1 only).

26/10/2025 : Code is a bit bad, because this was my first project in Java AND modding in minecraft. Do not use it.
              The project is dead, for now.

## Explanation
I just wanted to make minecraft modding more easier and accessible, while you still learn how to code.

The mod aim is to make you able to create, like an item, in only 1 or 2 function(s) call(s).

## Mod status

Client side : about 80% done

Server side : 0%

For now, the mod only allow you to do some bot since its client side only,

AND I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY UNINTENDED USE LIKE CHEATING IN ONLINE SERVERS.

I plan to make almost every modding possibity in java but ported to lua.

Some parts of the mod will be also probably "upgraded" for making things more simpler. 
(like for now inventory sort is using slot id only, which makes it hard to correctly get the right slot every time)
